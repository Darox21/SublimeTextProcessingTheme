# SublimeText Processing Theme

A Theme for the Processing 3.5 IDE, Close-ish to the sublime text color scheme

Inspired by [Jeff Thompson] (https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_3.0).  
Because I didn't like his.  

## CONTENTS

* `theme.txt`: Has the General changes
* `preferences-edit.txt`: Has the Changes to the preferences to change the text colors

## INSTALLATION

Before anything be sure to make a copy of the original files in the case you dont like it or if it
breaks something.


Replace the `theme.txt` file with this one

Inside the `preferences.txt` replace the `editor.token` lines with the `preferences-edit.txt`,  
preferences has many other options beside just text color, It's to not alter your own configuration.

* Windows: `C:\Program Files\Processing-{Version}\lib\theme.txt` and `%AppData%\Roaming\Processing\preferences.txt`
