# SublimeText Processing Theme

A Theme for the Processing 3.5 IDE, Close-ish to the sublime text color scheme. 

Inspired by [Jeff Thompson](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_3.0). Because I didn't like his.  

## CONTENTS

  * `theme.txt`: Has the General changes
  * `preferences-edit.txt`: Has the Changes to the text colors preferences

## INSTALLATION

Before anything be sure to make a copy of the original files in the case you dont like it or if it
breaks something.


Replace the `theme.txt` file with this one
  * Windows: `C:\Program Files\Processing-{Version}\lib\theme.txt`

Inside the `preferences.txt`: replace the `editor.token.{name} = {color}` lines with the variables from`preferences-edit.txt`
  * Windows: `%AppData%\Roaming\Processing\preferences.txt`

`preferences.txt` has many other options beside just text color, It's to not alter your own configuration.
